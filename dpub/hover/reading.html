<h1>The Death of Paper (Which Never Happened)</h1>
<h1>Alessandro Ludovico</h1>

<p>
<div class="what">
  In our present digital era, the ‘death of paper’ has become a plausible
  concept, widely expected to materialise sooner or later. The ‘digitisation
  of everything’ explicitly threatens to supplant every single ‘old’
  medium (anything carrying content in one way or another), while
  claiming to add new qualities, supposedly essential for the contemporary
  world: being mobile, searchable, editable, perhaps shareable. And
  indeed, all of the ‘old’ media have been radically transformed from
  their previous forms and modalities – as we have seen happen with
  records, radio and video. On the other hand, none of these media ever
  really disappeared; they ‘merely’ evolved and transformed, according
to new technical and industrial requirements.<span class="number">1</span>
