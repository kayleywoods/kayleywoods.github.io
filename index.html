Content is more accessible and more useful when it’s on the web; otherwise it may as well not exist for some people. The internet allows many people access to digital resources that they would otherwise miss out on, making it an incredible source for information. The internet reaches more people faster than any other medium available today, potentially signalling the downfall of paper in the future. Kenneth Goldsmith sees books heading in the same direction as CDs, tapes and videos: obsolete when faced with a better and more advanced alternative.

    <div class="book2_tldr tldr">
With mediums constantly changing and replacing what has come before them, Alessandro Ludovico believes that sooner or later paper will become a medium of the past. Technology must adapt to requirements of daily life and if it makes things easier, people will gravitate towards this.

    <div class="book3_tldr tldr">
Ferris Jabr discusses the many ways in which digital media can never fully replace paper, despite certainly offering an alternative. There are just some things that can’t be conveyed on screen: the  smell of a freshly printed page or the weight of a book. It’s harder to write notes in the margins of an Ebook and extremely difficult to navigate, unlike flipping between pages in a book. But, there are many advantages to reading on a screen as well and therefore it should not be entirely discounted as an great way of consuming information.
