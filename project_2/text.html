		<h1> 2006 AOL DATA LEAK </h1>

			Overview:
			<p>The AOL search data leak was the release, in August 2006, of detailed search logs by AOL of a large number of AOL users. The release was intentional and intended for research purposes; however, the public release meant that the entire Internet could see the results rather than a select number of academics. AOL did not redact any information, which caused privacy concerns since users could potentially be identified from their searches. </p>
			<p>On August 4, 2006, AOL Research, headed by Dr. Abdur Chowdhury, released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing twenty million search keywords for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period intended for research purposes. AOL deleted the search data on their site by August 7th, but not before it had been mirrored and distributed on the Internet.</p>

<p>AOL did not identify users in the report; however, personally identifiable information was present in many of the queries. As the queries were attributed by AOL to particular user numerically identified accounts, an individual could be identified and matched to their account and search history by such information. The New York Times was able to locate an individual from the released and anonymized search records by cross referencing them with phonebook listings.[2] Consequently, the ethical implications of using this data for research are under debate.</p>

<p>AOL acknowledged it was a mistake and removed the data; however, the removal was too late. The data was redistributed by others and can still be downloaded from mirror sites.</p>

<p>In January 2007, Business 2.0 Magazine on CNNMoney ranked the release of the search data #57 in a segment called "101 Dumbest Moments in Business."</p><br><br>
