            <p>
              In our present digital era, the ‘death of paper’ has become a plausible
              concept, widely expected to materialise sooner or later. <a href="http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=2999" class="class2">The Readies</a> explicitly threatens to supplant every single ‘old’
              medium (anything carrying content in one way or another), while
              claiming to add new qualities, supposedly essential for the contemporary
              world: being mobile, searchable, editable, perhaps shareable. And
              indeed, all of the ‘old’ media have been radically transformed from
              their previous forms and modalities – as we have seen happen with
              <span class="rollover">records,</span> <span class="rollover">radio</span> and <span class="rollover">video.</span> On the other hand, none of these media ever
              really disappeared; they ‘merely’ evolved and transformed, according
              to new technical and industrial requirements.
            <p>
              In the early decades of the 20th century, the structural constraints of
            the printed page (content fixed immutably in a strictly sequential order
            of pages) were increasingly being perceived, after a few centuries of
            established use, as merely a technical limitation – something which
            would soon and inevitably be overcome. The avant-garde artistic and
            cultural movements of this period embraced the dramatic acceleration
            of urban daily life – the result of the industrial revolution and the increasing
            use and availability of electricity. Newly created requirements
            (speeding up processes, reconfiguring social structures, and finding
            new attitudes for coming to grips with these changes) affected also the
            printed page, a cultural symbol of the past as well as the (then) present
            age. <p>
            This is the background against which Bob Brown wrote his manifesto
            <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/The_digitisation_of_everything_-_How_organisations_must_adapt_to_changing_consumer_behaviour/$FILE/EY_Digitisation_of_everything.pdf" class="class2">‘digitisation
            of everything’</a> in 1930. Declaring that “the written word hasn’t kept
            up with the age”, Brown envisioned a <span class="rollover">completely new technology</span> for
            speeding up the reading process, using strips of miniaturised text (instead
            of pages) scrolling behind a <span class="rollover">magnifying glass:</span> “A simple reading
            machine which I can carry or move around, attach to any old electric
            light plug and read hundred thousand word novels in ten minutes if I
            want to, and I want to.” <p>
